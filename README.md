I. Game Background
You are trapped in a mysterious forest shrouded in eternal mist, sealed off from the outside world by ancient magic. Legend says only by finding the Three Sacred Artifacts—the Compass Shard, Key, and Feather—scattered across the forest, and lifting the seal at the altar, can you escape this forgotten land. However, the forest is fraught with dangers: cliffs, mazes, magical barriers... You must rely on wit and courage to solve puzzles and uncover the forest's ultimate secret.
II. Core Gameplay
Explore Scenes: Navigate through different areas by entering directional commands (east/south/west/north) or special actions (e.g., "climb", "swim"). Each scene hides clues and items.
Collect Artifacts: Search for the Three Sacred Artifacts in locations like the Misty Path, Magic Garden, and Island in the Lake. These are essential to lift the seal.
Solve Puzzles: Use items to trigger events (e.g., climb a cliff with an iron hook, unlock a stone box with a key), or enter special commands (e.g., "lift the seal" on the island) to reveal hidden paths.
Escape the Forest: After gathering all artifacts, proceed to the altar to trigger the final event and escape!
